The Daily course format is based off the Weekly course format. Is shows sections as days rather than weeks. Useful for shorter courses or workshops.
==New Features (v2.0)==
When "Show one section per page" is selected in the course settings, the main course page looks like a calendar. (Thanks to Jon Africa for the idea and some CSS styling)
Tip: Start the course on a Sunday or Monday to simulate a calendar. Just hide the extra sections at the beginning of the course.
